Fast estimation of multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL) models in R with "Preference" space or "Willingness-to-pay" (WTP) space [utility parameterizations](https://jhelvy.github.io/logitr/articles/utility_models.html).

The latest version includes support for:

- Homogeneous multinomial logit (MNL) models
- Heterogeneous mixed logit (MXL) models with normal and log-normal parameter distributions.
- Preference space and WTP space utility parameterizations.
- Weighted models to differentially weight individual choice observations.
- Functions for computing WTP from preference space models.
- Functions for predicting expected choices and choice probabilities for a set (or multiple sets) of alternatives based on an estimated model.
- An option to run a multistart optimization loop that uses different random starting points in each iteration to search for different local minima (useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models with WTP space parameterizations).

Note: MXL models assume uncorrelated heterogeneity covariances and are estimated using maximum simulated likelihood based on the algorithms in Kenneth Train's book [*Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation, 2nd Edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009)*](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html).
